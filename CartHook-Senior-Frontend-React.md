## Basic CS 

Solve exercises A,B and explain your reasoning (use JavaScript).

A) Write a function that sorts 11 small numbers (<100) as fast as possible. Estimate how long it would take to execute that function 10 Billion (10^10) times on a normal machine?

B) Write a function that sorts 10000 powers (a^b) where a and b are random numbers between 100 and 10000? Estimate how long it would take on your machine?


## Advanced/Practical

Create a web application in React that enables users to find recipes based on ingredients/course names. Use this API to get all the information: http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/ 


A) Build the web app and push the code to github. (spend 8h max. Omit design if necessary, if you need cut features as well).
   - Use infinite scrolling technique instead of pagination (**required**)
   - Preserve the state of the application so the user comes back to the same experience after leaving the site (**optional**)
   
B) write a 1 page high level description of your solution. 


Answer: - what you've built - which technologies you've used and how it is tied together - your reasons for high-level decisions. If you feel anything is unclear, use your own judgement to make assumptions (make sure you explain them in B).
